# makeCacheMatrix()
# cacheSolve()

# Usage:

# first create a matrix, like z <- matrix(c(1,3,3,1),2,2)

# then call a <- makeCacheMatrix(z), this will create the functions get, set, getsolve, and setsolve
# which will be accessible through the variable a

# you can now solve (invert) the matrix by calling b <- cacheSolve(a)
# you can store the result into the cache by calling a$set(b)
# and you can verify that the results are in cache by calling m <- a$get()
